# Data-Wrangling-Projects-and-Tasks

The purpose of this repository is to share the projects that I have completed in my Data Wrangling course this semester.

I have received permission to share all the work in this repository. 

The following content briefly lists the tasks that were completed in each individual project. 

Project #1 in SQL: 
- renaming columns 
- create new column and assign corresponding values to data in separate column 
- create new column with corresponding integer intervals 

Project #2 in SQL:
-create new columns and assign values to data within column 
-calculate the count of different data values
-use joins to combine tables 
-find maximum, counts, and distinct values from newly merged table
-use DATEDIFF to calculate the number of texts weekly over a period of time

Project #3 in R: 
-rearrange, combine, and compute rates from resulting tables
-converting dates and times to usable formats 
-plotting (flight) timings and looking for trends
-comparing various timings for consistency using plot
-webscraping to extract headings, length of titles, and obtaining general information 

Project Midterm in R and SQL: 
-renaming columns that reflect data content in column 
-changing numerical factor levels to reflect the data they represented
-changing data type for calculations 
-standardizing data to a single measure across the dataset (for columns that contained numerical data) 
-computing counts for different variables to compare to information from data source 
-deleting rows that were mostly missing values (thus, insignificantly contributing to dataset)
