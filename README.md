# Data-Wrangling-Projects-and-Tasks

The purpose of this repository is to share the projects that I have completed in my Data Wrangling course this semester.

The codes presented in this repository have been approved for sharing by the instructor for this course. 

The following content briefly lists the tasks that were completed in each individual project. 

Project #1 in SQL: 
- renaming columns 
- create new column and assign corresponding values to data in separate column 
- create new column with corresponding integer intervals 

Project #2 in SQL:
- create new columns and assign values to data within column 
- calculate the count of different data values
- use joins to combine tables 
- find maximum, counts, and distinct values from newly merged table
- use DATEDIFF to calculate the number of texts weekly over a period of time

Project #3 in R: 
- rearrange, combine, and compute rates from resulting tables
- converting dates and times to usable formats 
- plotting (flight) timings and looking for trends
- comparing various timings for consistency using plot
- webscraping to extract headings, length of titles, and obtaining general information 

Project Midterm in R and SQL: 
- renaming columns that reflect data content in column 
- changing numerical factor levels to reflect the data they represented
- changing data type for calculations 
- standardizing data to a single measure across the dataset (for columns that contained numerical data) 
- computing counts for different variables to compare to information from data source 
- deleting rows that were mostly missing values (thus, insignificantly contributing to dataset) 

Project Final in R and SQL with blood pressure dataset: 
- Rename factor levels with description of the data they represent 
- combine tables to obtain information on intervention programs 
- find average weekly values for intervention data to track change over time 
- combine tables and extract most recent value based on sent date (in both SQL and R, using ODBC driver)
